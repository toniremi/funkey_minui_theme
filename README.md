# Funkey RetroFe MinUI theme
A RetroFE 1:1 (240x240) theme for the Funkey S CFW inspired by MinUI.

This is a simple theme for the [Funkey OS](https://github.com/FunKey-Project/FunKey-OS) or [DrUm78 Custom CFW](https://github.com/DrUm78/FunKey-OS) that can run on the Funkey S, RG Nano or PowKiddy Q36.

I made this theme because I love MinUI and its simplicity. I loaded my RGNano with a lot of roms and wanted something to navigate easily in a single page.

## Install

To use one of the theme listed above, begin by downloading and extracting its associated ZIP file from the releases. Unzip the zip file and you should see a folder called MinUI. With the FunKey S mounted to your computer, first copy and paste the generated folder into the /mnt/FunKey/.retrofe/layouts section of the FunKey S file system. Finally edit the layout file wiht a text editor and include `MinUI` there to display this theme.

After this you should see the theme listed in the theme options and should be able to switch to it.
