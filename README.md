# Funkey RetroFe MinUI theme
A RetroFE 1:1 (240x240) theme for the Funkey S CFW inspired by MinUI.

This is a simple theme for the [Funkey OS](https://github.com/FunKey-Project/FunKey-OS) or [DrUm78 Custom CFW](https://github.com/DrUm78/FunKey-OS) that can run on the Funkey S, RG Nano or PowKiddy Q36.

I made this theme because I love MinUI and its simplicity. I loaded my RGNano with a lot of roms and wanted something to navigate easily in a single page.
